/**
 * --- Day 3: Squares With Three Sides ---
 *
 * Now that you can think clearly, you move deeper into the labyrinth of hallways and
 * office furniture that makes up this part of Easter Bunny HQ. This must be a graphic
 * design department; the walls are covered in specifications for triangles.
 *
 * Or are they?
 *
 * The design document gives the side lengths of each triangle it describes,
 * but... 5 10 25? Some of these aren't triangles. You can't help but mark the impossible ones.
 *
 * In a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be larger than the remaining side.
 * For example, the "triangle" given above is impossible, because 5 + 10 is not larger than 25.
 *
 * In your puzzle input, **how many** of the listed triangles are **possible**?
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was 993.
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 *
 * Now that you've helpfully marked up their design documents, it occurs to you that
 * triangles are specified in groups of three vertically. Each set of three numbers
 * in a column specifies a triangle. Rows are unrelated.
 *
 * For example, given the following specification, numbers with the same hundreds digit
 * would be part of the same triangle:
 *
 *    101 301 501
 *    102 302 502
 *    103 303 503
 *    201 401 601
 *    202 402 602
 *    203 403 603
 *
 * In your puzzle input, and instead reading by columns, how many of the listed
 * triangles are possible?
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was 1849.
