/**
 * --- Day 6: Signals and Noise ---
 *
 * Something is jamming your communications with Santa. Fortunately, your signal is
 * only partially jammed, and protocol in situations like this is to switch to a simple
 * repetition code to get the message through.
 *
 * In this model, the same message is sent repeatedly. You've recorded the repeating
 * message signal (your puzzle input), but the data seems quite corrupted - almost too
 * badly to recover. **Almost**.
 *
 * All you need to do is figure out which character is most frequent for each position.
 * For example, suppose you had recorded the following messages:
 *
 *    eedadn
 *    drvtee
 *    eandsr
 *    raavrd
 *    atevrs
 *    tsrnev
 *    sdttsa
 *    rasrtv
 *    nssdts
 *    ntnada
 *    svetve
 *    tesnvt
 *    vntsnd
 *    vrdear
 *    dvrsen
 *    enarar
 * The most common character in the first column is e; in the second, a; in the third, s,
 * and so on. Combining these characters returns the error-corrected message, `easter`.
 *
 * Given the recording in your puzzle input, **what is the error-corrected version of
 * the message being sent?**
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was tzstqsua.
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 *
 * Of course, that **would** be the message - if you hadn't agreed to use a **modified
 * repetition code** instead.
 *
 * In this modified code, the sender instead transmits what looks like random data,
 * but for each character, the character they actually want to send is **slightly
 * less likely** than the others. Even after signal-jamming noise, you can look at
 * the letter distributions in each column and choose the **least common** letter to
 * reconstruct the original message.
 *
 * In the above example, the least common character in the first column is a;
 * in the second, d, and so on. Repeating this process for the remaining characters
 * produces the original message, advent.
 *
 * Given the recording in your puzzle input and this new decoding methodology,
 * **what is the original message** that Santa is trying to send?
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was `myregdnr`.
