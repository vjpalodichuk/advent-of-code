/**
 * --- Day 24: Air Duct Spelunking ---
 *
 * You've finally met your match; the doors that provide access to the roof are locked tight,
 * and all the controls and related electronics are inaccessible. You simply can't reach them.
 *
 * The robot that cleans the air ducts, however, **can.**
 *
 * It's not a very fast little robot, but you reconfigure it to be able to interface with
 * some of the exposed wires that have been routed through the HVAC system. If you can
 * direct it to each of those locations, you should be able to bypass the security controls.
 *
 * You extract the duct layout for this area from some blueprints you acquired and create a
 * map with the relevant locations marked (your puzzle input). 0 is your current location,
 * from which the cleaning robot embarks; the other numbers are (in **no particular order**)
 * the locations the robot needs to visit at least once each. Walls are marked as #, and
 * open passages are marked as .. Numbers behave like open passages.
 *
 * For example, suppose you have a map like the following:
 *
 * ```
 * ###########
 * #0.1.....2#
 * #.#######.#
 * #4.......3#
 * ###########
 * ```
 *
 * To reach all the points of interest as quickly as possible, you would have the
 * robot take the following path:
 *
 * - 0 to 4 (2 steps)
 * - 4 to 1 (4 steps; it can't move diagonally)
 * - 1 to 2 (6 steps)
 * - 2 to 3 (2 steps)
 *
 * Since the robot isn't very fast, you need to find it the **shortest route.** This path is the
 * fewest steps (in the above example, a total of 14) required to start at 0 and then visit
 * every other location at least once.
 *
 * Given your actual map, and starting from location 0, what is the **fewest number of steps**
 * required to visit every non-0 number marked on the map at least once?
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was .
 *
 * **--- Part Two ---**
