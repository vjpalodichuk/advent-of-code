/**
 * **--- Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases ---**
 *
 * A new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use
 * a **passphrase** instead of simply a pass**word**. A passphrase consists of a series
 * of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.
 *
 * To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * - aa bb cc dd ee is valid.
 * - aa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.
 * - aa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.
 *
 * The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. **How many
 * passphrases are valid?**
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was **477**.
 *
 * **--- Part Two ---**
 *
 * For added security, yet another system policy has been put in place. Now, a valid passphrase
 * must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other - that is, a passphrase is
 * invalid if any word's letters can be rearranged to form any other word in the passphrase.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * - abcde fghij is a valid passphrase.
 * - abcde xyz ecdab is not valid - the letters from the third word can be rearranged to
 * form the first word.
 * - a ab abc abd abf abj is a valid passphrase, because all letters need to be used when
 * forming another word.
 * - iiii oiii ooii oooi oooo is valid.
 * - oiii ioii iioi iiio is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to form any
 * other word.
 *
 * Under this new system policy, **how many passphrases are valid?**
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was **167**.
