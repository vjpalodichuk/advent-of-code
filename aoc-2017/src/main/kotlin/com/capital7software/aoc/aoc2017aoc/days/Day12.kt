/**
 * **--- Day 12: Digital Plumber ---**
 *
 * Walking along the memory banks of the stream, you find a small village that is experiencing a
 * little confusion: some programs can't communicate with each other.
 *
 * Programs in this village communicate using a fixed system of **pipes**. Messages are passed
 * between programs using these pipes, but most programs aren't connected to each other
 * directly. Instead, programs pass messages between each other until the message
 * reaches the intended recipient.
 *
 * For some reason, though, some of these messages aren't ever reaching their intended recipient,
 * and the programs suspect that some pipes are missing. They would like you to investigate.
 *
 * You walk through the village and record the ID of each program and the IDs with which it can
 * communicate directly (your puzzle input). Each program has one or more programs with which
 * it can communicate, and these pipes are bidirectional; if 8 says it can communicate with 11,
 * then 11 will say it can communicate with 8.
 *
 * You need to figure out how many programs are in the group that contains program ID 0.
 *
 * For example, suppose you go door-to-door like a travelling salesman and record
 * the following list:
 *
 * ```
 * 0 <-> 2
 * 1 <-> 1
 * 2 <-> 0, 3, 4
 * 3 <-> 2, 4
 * 4 <-> 2, 3, 6
 * 5 <-> 6
 * 6 <-> 4, 5
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, the following programs are in the group that contains program ID 0:
 *
 * - Program 0 by definition.
 * - Program 2, directly connected to program 0.
 * - Program 3 via program 2.
 * - Program 4 via program 2.
 * - Program 5 via programs 6, then 4, then 2.
 * - Program 6 via programs 4, then 2.
 *
 * Therefore, a total of 6 programs are in this group; all but program 1, which has a pipe
 * that connects it to itself.
 *
 * **How many programs** are in the group that contains program ID 0?
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was **378**.
 *
 * **--- Part Two ---**
 *
 * There are more programs than just the ones in the group containing program ID 0.
 * The rest of them have no way of reaching that group, and still might have no way
 * of reaching each other.
 *
 * A **group** is a collection of programs that can all communicate via pipes either
 * directly or indirectly. The programs you identified just a moment ago are all
 * part of the same group. Now, they would like you to determine the total number
 * of groups.
 *
 * In the example above, there were 2 groups: one consisting of programs 0,2,3,4,5,6,
 * and the other consisting solely of program 1.
 *
 * **How many groups** are there in total?
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was **204**.
