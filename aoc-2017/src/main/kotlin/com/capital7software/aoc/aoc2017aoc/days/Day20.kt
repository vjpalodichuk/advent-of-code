/**
 * **--- Day 20: Particle Swarm ---**
 *
 * Suddenly, the GPU contacts you, asking for help. Someone has asked it to simulate
 * **too many particles**, and it won't be able to finish them all in time to render
 * the next frame at this rate.
 *
 * It transmits to you a buffer (your puzzle input) listing each particle in order
 * (starting with particle 0, then particle 1, particle 2, and so on). For each particle,
 * it provides the X, Y, and Z coordinates for the particle's position (p), velocity (v),
 * and acceleration (a), each in the format <X,Y,Z>.
 *
 * Each tick, all particles are updated simultaneously. A particle's properties are
 * updated in the following order:
 *
 * - Increase the X velocity by the X acceleration.
 * - Increase the Y velocity by the Y acceleration.
 * - Increase the Z velocity by the Z acceleration.
 * - Increase the X position by the X velocity.
 * - Increase the Y position by the Y velocity.
 * - Increase the Z position by the Z velocity.
 *
 * Because of seemingly tenuous rationale involving z-buffering, the GPU would like to know
 * which particle will stay closest to position <0,0,0> in the long term. Measure this using
 * the Manhattan distance, which in this situation is simply the sum of the absolute values
 * of a particle's X, Y, and Z position.
 *
 * For example, suppose you are only given two particles, both of which stay entirely on
 * the X-axis (for simplicity). Drawing the current states of particles 0 and 1 (in that order)
 * with an adjacent a number line and diagram of current X positions (marked in parentheses),
 * the following would take place:
 *
 * ```
 * p=< 3,0,0>, v=< 2,0,0>, a=<-1,0,0>    -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4
 * p=< 4,0,0>, v=< 0,0,0>, a=<-2,0,0>                         (0)(1)
 *
 * p=< 4,0,0>, v=< 1,0,0>, a=<-1,0,0>    -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4
 * p=< 2,0,0>, v=<-2,0,0>, a=<-2,0,0>                      (1)   (0)
 *
 * p=< 4,0,0>, v=< 0,0,0>, a=<-1,0,0>    -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4
 * p=<-2,0,0>, v=<-4,0,0>, a=<-2,0,0>          (1)               (0)
 *
 * p=< 3,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=<-1,0,0>    -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4
 * p=<-8,0,0>, v=<-6,0,0>, a=<-2,0,0>                         (0)
 * ```
 *
 * At this point, particle 1 will never be closer to <0,0,0> than particle 0, and so,
 * in the long run, particle 0 will stay closest.
 *
 * **Which particle will stay closest to position <0,0,0>** in the long term?
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was **376**.
 *
 * **--- Part Two ---**
 *
 * To simplify the problem further, the GPU would like to remove any particles that **collide**.
 * Particles collide if their positions ever **exactly match**. Because particles are updated
 * simultaneously, **more than two particles** can collide at the same time and place.
 * Once particles collide, they are removed and cannot collide with anything else after that tick.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * p=<-6,0,0>, v=< 3,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>
 * p=<-4,0,0>, v=< 2,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3
 * p=<-2,0,0>, v=< 1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    (0)   (1)   (2)            (3)
 * p=< 3,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>
 *
 * p=<-3,0,0>, v=< 3,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>
 * p=<-2,0,0>, v=< 2,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3
 * p=<-1,0,0>, v=< 1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>             (0)(1)(2)      (3)
 * p=< 2,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>
 *
 * p=< 0,0,0>, v=< 3,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>
 * p=< 0,0,0>, v=< 2,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3
 * p=< 0,0,0>, v=< 1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>                       X (3)
 * p=< 1,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>
 *
 * ------destroyed by collision------
 * ------destroyed by collision------    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3
 * ------destroyed by collision------                      (3)
 * p=< 0,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, particles 0, 1, and 2 are simultaneously destroyed at the time and
 * place marked X. On the next tick, particle 3 passes through unharmed.
 *
 * **How many particles are left** after all collisions are resolved?
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was **574**.
