/**
 * **--- Day 8: Resonant Collinearity ---**
 *
 * You find yourselves on the [roof](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/25) of a top-secret
 * Easter Bunny installation.
 *
 * While The Historians do their thing, you take a look at the familiar **huge antenna**.
 * Much to your surprise, it seems to have been reconfigured to emit a signal that makes
 * people 0.1% more likely to buy Easter Bunny brand Imitation Mediocre Chocolate as a
 * Christmas gift! Unthinkable!
 *
 * Scanning across the city, you find that there are actually many such antennas. Each antenna
 * is tuned to a specific **frequency** indicated by a single lowercase letter, uppercase letter,
 * or digit. You create a map (your puzzle input) of these antennas. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * ............
 * ........0...
 * .....0......
 * .......0....
 * ....0.......
 * ......A.....
 * ............
 * ............
 * ........A...
 * .........A..
 * ............
 * ............
 * ```
 *
 * The signal only applies its nefarious effect at specific **antinodes** based on the resonant
 * frequencies of the antennas. In particular, an antinode occurs at any point that is perfectly
 * in line with two antennas of the same frequency - but only when one of the antennas is twice
 * as far away as the other. This means that for any pair of antennas with the same frequency,
 * there are two antinodes, one on either side of them.
 *
 * So, for these two antennas with frequency ```a```, they create the two antinodes marked
 * with ```#```:
 *
 * ```
 * ..........
 * ...#......
 * ..........
 * ....a.....
 * ..........
 * .....a....
 * ..........
 * ......#...
 * ..........
 * ..........
 * ```
 *
 * Adding a third antenna with the same frequency creates several more antinodes. It would
 * ideally add four antinodes, but two are off the right side of the map, so instead
 * it adds only two:
 *
 * ```
 * ..........
 * ...#......
 * #.........
 * ....a.....
 * ........a.
 * .....a....
 * ..#.......
 * ......#...
 * ..........
 * ..........
 * ```
 *
 * Antennas with different frequencies don't create antinodes; ```A``` and ```a``` count as
 * different frequencies. However, antinodes **can** occur at locations that contain antennas.
 * In this diagram, the lone antenna with frequency capital ```A``` creates no antinodes but
 * has a lowercase-```a```-frequency antinode at its location:
 *
 * ```
 * ..........
 * ...#......
 * #.........
 * ....a.....
 * ........a.
 * .....a....
 * ..#.......
 * ......A...
 * ..........
 * ..........
 * ```
 *
 * The first example has antennas with two different frequencies, so the antinodes they create
 * look like this, plus an antinode overlapping the topmost ```A```-frequency antenna:
 *
 * ```
 * ......#....#
 * ...#....0...
 * ....#0....#.
 * ..#....0....
 * ....0....#..
 * .#....A.....
 * ...#........
 * #......#....
 * ........A...
 * .........A..
 * ..........#.
 * ..........#.
 * ```
 *
 * Because the topmost ```A```-frequency antenna overlaps with a ```0```-frequency antinode,
 * there are **```14```** total unique locations that contain an antinode within the bounds
 * of the map.
 *
 * Calculate the impact of the signal. **How many unique locations within the bounds of the
 * map contain an antinode?**
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was **```244```**.
 *
 * **--- Part Two ---**
 *
 * Watching over your shoulder as you work, one of The Historians asks if you took the effects of
 * resonant harmonics into your calculations.
 *
 * Whoops!
 *
 * After updating your model, it turns out that an antinode occurs at **any grid position**
 * exactly in line with at least two antennas of the same frequency, regardless of distance.
 * This means that some of the new antinodes will occur at the position of each antenna (unless
 * that antenna is the only one of its frequency).
 *
 * So, these three ```T```-frequency antennas now create many antinodes:
 *
 * ```
 * T....#....
 * ...T......
 * .T....#...
 * .........#
 * ..#.......
 * ..........
 * ...#......
 * ..........
 * ....#.....
 * ..........
 * ```
 *
 * In fact, the three ```T```-frequency antennas are all exactly in line with two antennas, so
 * they are all also antinodes! This brings the total number of antinodes in the above example
 * to **```9```**.
 *
 * The original example now has **```34```** antinodes, including the antinodes that appear on
 * every antenna:
 *
 * ```
 * ##....#....#
 * .#.#....0...
 * ..#.#0....#.
 * ..##...0....
 * ....0....#..
 * .#...#A....#
 * ...#..#.....
 * #....#.#....
 * ..#.....A...
 * ....#....A..
 * .#........#.
 * ...#......##
 * ```
 *
 * Calculate the impact of the signal using this updated model. **How many unique locations within
 * the bounds of the map contain an antinode?**
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was **```912```**.
