   * To finish the calibrations someone needs to determine which test values could possibly be
   * produced by placing any combination of operators into their calibration equations.
   *
   * For example:
   *
   * ```
   * 190: 10 19
   * 3267: 81 40 27
   * 83: 17 5
   * 156: 15 6
   * 7290: 6 8 6 15
   * 161011: 16 10 13
   * 192: 17 8 14
   * 21037: 9 7 18 13
   * 292: 11 6 16 20
   * ```
   *
   * Each line represents a single equation. The test value appears before the colon on each line;
   * it is your job to determine whether the remaining numbers can be combined with operators to
   * produce the test value.
   *
   * Operators are **always evaluated left-to-right**, **not** according to precedence rules.
   * Furthermore, numbers in the equations cannot be rearranged. Glancing into the jungle, you
   * can see elephants holding two different types of operators: **add** (```+```) and **multiply**
   * (```*```).
   *
   * Only three of the above equations can be made true by inserting operators:
   *
   * - ```190: 10 19``` has only one position that accepts an operator: between ```10``` and
   * ```19```. Choosing ```+``` would give ```29```, but choosing ```*``` would give the test
   * value (```10 * 19 = 190```).
   * - ```3267: 81 40 27``` has two positions for operators. Of the four possible configurations of
   * the operators, **two** cause the right side to match the test value: ```81 + 40 * 27``` and
   * ```81 * 40 + 27``` both equal ```3267``` (when evaluated left-to-right)!
   * - ```292: 11 6 16 20``` can be solved in exactly one way: ```11 + 6 * 16 + 20```.
   *
   * The engineers just need the **total calibration result**, which is the sum of the test values
   * from just the equations that could possibly be true. In the above example, the sum of the test
   * values for the three equations listed above is **```3749```**.
   *
   * **To use only add and multiply operators, set [addAndMulOnly] to true**.
   *
   * The engineers seem concerned; the total calibration result you gave them is nowhere close to
   * being within safety tolerances. Just then, you spot your mistake: some well-hidden elephants
   * are holding a **third type of operator**.
   *
   * The [concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation) operator (```||```) combines
   * the digits from its left and right inputs into a single number. For example, ```12 || 345```
   * would become ```12345```. All operators are still evaluated left-to-right.
   *
   * Now, apart from the three equations that could be made true using only addition
   * and multiplication, the above example has three more equations that can be made
   * true by inserting operators:
   *
   * - ```156: 15 6``` can be made true through a single concatenation: ```15 || 6 = 156```.
   * - ```7290: 6 8 6 15``` can be made true using ```6 * 8 || 6 * 15```.
   * - ```192: 17 8 14``` can be made true using ```17 || 8 + 14```.
   *
   * Adding up all six test values (the three that could be made before using only ```+``` and
   * ```*``` plus the new three that can now be made by also using ```||```) produces the new
   * **total calibration result** of **```11387```**.
   *
   * @param addAndMulOnly If true, then only complete and valid results are returned; otherwise,
   * all complete results are returned.
   * @return A [Map] where the key is the unique [CalibrationTest] and the value is a [List] of
   * complete solutions.
