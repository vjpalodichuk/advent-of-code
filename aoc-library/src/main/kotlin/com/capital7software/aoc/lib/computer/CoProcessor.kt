/**
 * **--- Day 23: Coprocessor Conflagration ---**
 *
 * You decide to head directly to the CPU and fix the printer from there.
 * As you get close, you find an **experimental coprocessor** doing so much work that the
 * local programs are afraid it will halt and catch fire. This would cause serious issues
 * for the rest of the computer, so you head in and see what you can do.
 *
 * The code it's running seems to be a variant of the kind you saw recently on that tablet.
 * The general functionality seems **very similar**, but some of the instructions are different:
 *
 * - set X Y **sets** register X to the value of Y.
 * - sub X Y **decreases** register X by the value of Y.
 * - mul X Y sets register X to the result of **multiplying** the value contained in
 * register X by the value of Y.
 * - jnz X Y **jumps** with an offset of the value of Y, but only if the value of X
 * is **not zero**. (An offset of 2 skips the next instruction, an offset of -1 jumps
 * to the previous instruction, and so on.)
 *
 * Only the instructions listed above are used. The eight registers here,
 * named a through h, all start at 0.
 *
 * The coprocessor is currently set to some kind of **debug mode**, which allows for testing,
 * but prevents it from doing any meaningful work.
 *
 * Now, it's time to fix the problem.
 *
 * The **debug mode switch** is wired directly to register a. You flip the switch, which
 * makes **register a now start at 1** when the program is executed.
 *
 * Immediately, the coprocessor begins to overheat. Whoever wrote this program obviously
 * didn't choose a very efficient implementation. You'll need to **optimize the program** if
 * it has any hope of completing before Santa needs that printer working.
 *
 * The coprocessor's ultimate goal is to determine the final value left in register h
 * once the program completes. Technically, if it had that... it wouldn't even need
 * to run the program.
 *
 * @param debugger The debugger to use for this instance.
