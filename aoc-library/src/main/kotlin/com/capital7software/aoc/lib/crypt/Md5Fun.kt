   * As the door slides open, you are presented with a second door that uses a slightly more

   * the password decrypted **in order**?!), the Easter Bunny engineers have worked out
   * a better solution.
   *
   * Instead of simply filling in the password from left to right, the hash now also
   * indicates the **position** within the password to fill. You still look for hashes that
   * begin with five zeroes; however, now, the **sixth** character represents
   * the **position** (0-7), and the **seventh** character is the character to put in that position.
   *
   * A hash result of 000001f means that f is the **second** character in the password.
   * Use only the **first result** for each position, and ignore invalid positions.
   *
   * For example, if the Door ID is `abc`:
   *
   * - The first interesting hash is from abc3231929, which produces 0000015...; so,
   * 5 goes in position 1: _5______.
   *
   * - In the previous method, 5017308 produced an interesting hash; however, it is ignored,
   * because it specifies an invalid position (8).
   *
   * - The second interesting hash is at index 5357525, which produces 000004e...; so, e
   * goes in position 4: _5__e___.
   *
   * You almost choke on your popcorn as the final character falls into place, producing
   * the password `05ace8e3`.

  /**
   * To generate keys, you first get a stream of random data by taking the
   * MD5 of a pre-arranged salt (your puzzle input) and an increasing integer
   * index (starting with 0, and represented in decimal); the resulting MD5 hash
   * should be represented as a string of **lowercase** hexadecimal digits.
   *
   * However, not all of these MD5 hashes are **keys**, and you need 64 new keys
   * for your one-time pad. A hash is a key **only if:**
   *
   * - It contains **three** of the same character in a row, like 777. Only consider
   * the first such triplet in a hash.
   * - One of the next 1000 hashes in the stream contains that same character **five**
   * times in a row, like 77777.
   *
   * Considering future hashes for five-of-a-kind sequences does not cause those hashes
   * to be skipped; instead, regardless of whether the current hash is a key, always
   * resume testing for keys starting with the very next hash.
   *
   * For example, if the pre-arranged salt is abc:
   *
   * - The first index which produces a triple is 18, because the MD5 hash of abc18
   * contains ...cc38887a5.... However, index 18 does not count as a key for your
   * one-time pad, because none of the next thousand hashes (index 19 through index 1018)
   * contain 88888.
   * - The next index which produces a triple is 39; the hash of abc39 contains eee.
   * It is also the first key: one of the next thousand hashes (the one at index 816)
   * contains eeeee.
   * - None of the next six triples are keys, but the one after that, at index 92,
   * is: it contains 999 and index 200 contains 99999.
   * - Eventually, index 22728 meets all the criteria to generate the 64th key.
   *
   * So, using our example salt of abc, index 22728 produces the 64th key.
   *
   * Of course, in order to make this process even more secure, you've also implemented
   * key stretching.
   *
   * Key stretching forces attackers to spend more time generating hashes. Unfortunately,
   * it forces everyone else to spend more time, too.
   *
   * To implement key stretching, whenever you generate a hash, before you use it, you first
   * find the MD5 hash of that hash, then the MD5 hash of **that** hash, and so on, a total of
   * **2016 additional hashings**. Always use lowercase hexadecimal representations of hashes.
   *
   * For example, to find the stretched hash for index 0 and salt abc:
   *
   * - Find the MD5 hash of abc0: 577571be4de9dcce85a041ba0410f29f.
   * - Then, find the MD5 hash of that hash: eec80a0c92dc8a0777c619d9bb51e910.
   * - Then, find the MD5 hash of that hash: 16062ce768787384c81fe17a7a60c7e3.
   * - ...repeat many times...
   * - Then, find the MD5 hash of that hash: a107ff634856bb300138cac6568c0f24.
   *
   * So, the stretched hash for index 0 in this situation is a107ff.... In the end, you
   * find the original hash (one use of MD5), then find the hash-of-the-previous-hash 2016
   * times, for a total of 2017 uses of MD5.
   *
   * The rest of the process remains the same, but now the keys are entirely different.
   * Again for salt abc:
   *
   * - The first triple (222, at index 5) has no matching 22222 in the next thousand hashes.
   * - The second triple (eee, at index 10) hash a matching eeeee at index 89, and so
   * it is the first key.
   * - Eventually, index 22551 produces the 64th key (triple fff with matching fffff at
   * index 22859.
   *
   * @param salt The salt to use when generating a hash.
   * @param limit The maximum number of keys to generate.
   * @param startIndex The index to start generating keys from.
   * @param stretched If true, the hashes are stretched before being used.
   * @return A [List] of [Pair] where the first element is the key and the second is the index.
