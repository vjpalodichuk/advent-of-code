/**
 * You all arrive at a [Lava Production Facility](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/15) on a
 * floating island in the sky. As the others begin to search the massive industrial complex, you
 * feel a small nose boop your leg and look down to discover a reindeer wearing a hard hat.
 *
 * The reindeer is holding a book titled "Lava Island Hiking Guide". However, when you open
 * the book, you discover that most of it seems to have been scorched by lava! As you're
 * about to ask how you can help, the reindeer brings you a blank
 * [topographic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map) of the surrounding area
 * (your puzzle input) and looks up at you excitedly.
 *
 * Perhaps you can help fill in the missing hiking trails?
 *
 * The topographic map indicates the **height** at each position using a scale from ```0```
 * (lowest) to ```9``` (highest). For example:
 *
 * ```
 * 0123
 * 1234
 * 8765
 * 9876
 * ```
 *
 * Based on un-scorched scraps of the book, you determine that a good hiking trail is
 * **as long as possible** and has an **even, gradual, uphill slope**. For all practical
 * purposes, this means that a hiking trail is any path that starts at height ```0```,
 * ends at height ```9```, and always increases by a height of exactly 1 at each step.
 * Hiking trails never include diagonal steps - only up, down, left, or right
 * (from the perspective of the map).
 *
 * You look up from the map and notice that the reindeer has helpfully begun to construct
 * a small pile of pencils, markers, rulers, compasses, stickers, and other equipment you
 * might need to update the map with hiking trails.
 *
 * A **trailhead** is any position that starts one or more hiking trails - here, these
 * positions will always have height ```0```. Assembling more fragments of pages, you
 * establish that a trailhead's ```score``` is the number of ```9```-height positions
 * reachable from that trailhead via a hiking trail. In the above example, the single
 * trailhead in the top left corner has a score of ```1``` because it can reach a
 * single ```9``` (the one in the bottom left).
 *
 * This trailhead has a score of ```2```:
 *
 * ```
 * ...0...
 * ...1...
 * ...2...
 * 6543456
 * 7.....7
 * 8.....8
 * 9.....9
 * ```
 *
 * (The positions marked ```.``` are impassable tiles to simplify these examples; they do
 * not appear on your actual topographic map.)
 *
 * This trailhead has a score of ```4``` because every ```9``` is reachable via a hiking
 * trail except the one immediately to the left of the trailhead:
 *
 * ```
 * ..90..9
 * ...1.98
 * ...2..7
 * 6543456
 * 765.987
 * 876....
 * 987....
 * ```
 *
 * This topographic map contains **two** trailheads; the trailhead at the top has a score
 * of ```1```, while the trailhead at the bottom has a score of ```2```:
 *
 * ```
 * 10..9..
 * 2...8..
 * 3...7..
 * 4567654
 * ...8..3
 * ...9..2
 * .....01
 * ```
 *
 * Here's a larger example:
 *
 * ```
 * 89010123
 * 78121874
 * 87430965
 * 96549874
 * 45678903
 * 32019012
 * 01329801
 * 10456732
 * ```
 *
 * This larger example has 9 trailheads. Considering the trailheads in reading order,
 * they have scores of ```5```, ```6```, ```5```, ```3```, ```1```, ```3```, ```5```,
 * ```3```, and ```5```. Adding these scores together, the sum of the scores of all
 * trailheads is **```36```**.
 *
 * The reindeer spends a few minutes reviewing your hiking trail map before realizing
 * something, disappearing for a few minutes, and finally returning with yet another
 * slightly-charred piece of paper.
 *
 * The paper describes a second way to measure a trailhead called its **rating**. A trailhead's
 * rating is the **number of distinct hiking trails** which begin at that trailhead. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * .....0.
 * ..4321.
 * ..5..2.
 * ..6543.
 * ..7..4.
 * ..8765.
 * ..9....
 * ```
 *
 * The above map has a single trailhead; its rating is ```3``` because there are exactly
 * three distinct hiking trails which begin at that position:
 *
 * ```
 * .....0.   .....0.   .....0.
 * ..4321.   .....1.   .....1.
 * ..5....   .....2.   .....2.
 * ..6....   ..6543.   .....3.
 * ..7....   ..7....   .....4.
 * ..8....   ..8....   ..8765.
 * ..9....   ..9....   ..9....
 * ```
 *
 * Here is a map containing a single trailhead with rating ```13```:
 *
 * ```
 * ..90..9
 * ...1.98
 * ...2..7
 * 6543456
 * 765.987
 * 876....
 * 987....
 * ```
 *
 * This map contains a single trailhead with rating ```227``` (because there are ```121```
 * distinct hiking trails that lead to the ```9``` on the right edge and ```106``` that
 * lead to the ```9``` on the bottom edge):
 *
 * ```
 * 012345
 * 123456
 * 234567
 * 345678
 * 4.6789
 * 56789.
 * ```
 *
 * Here's the larger example from before:
 *
 * ```
 * 89010123
 * 78121874
 * 87430965
 * 96549874
 * 45678903
 * 32019012
 * 01329801
 * 10456732
 * ```
 *
 * Considering its trailheads in reading order, they have ratings of ```20```, ```24```,
 * ```10```, ```4```, ```1```, ```4```, ```5```, ```8```, and ```5```. The sum of all
 * trailhead ratings in this larger example topographic map is **```81```**.
