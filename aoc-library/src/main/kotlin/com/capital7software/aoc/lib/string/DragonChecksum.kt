/**
 * You're done scanning this part of the network, but you've left traces of your presence.
 * You need to overwrite some disks with random-looking data to cover your tracks and
 * update the local security system with a new checksum for those disks.
 *
 * For the data to not be suspicious, it needs to have certain properties; purely
 * random data will be detected as tampering. To generate appropriate random data,
 * you'll need to use a modified dragon curve.
 *
 * Start with an appropriate initial state (your puzzle input). Then, so long as you
 * don't have enough data yet to fill the disk, repeat the following steps:
 *
 * - Call the data you have at this point "a".
 * - Make a copy of "a"; call this copy "b".
 * - Reverse the order of the characters in "b".
 * - In "b", replace all instances of 0 with 1 and all 1s with 0.
 * - The resulting data is "a", then a single 0, then "b".
 *
 * For example, after a single step of this process,
 *
 * - 1 becomes 100.
 * - 0 becomes 001.
 * - 11111 becomes 11111000000.
 * - 111100001010 becomes 1111000010100101011110000.
 *
 * Repeat these steps until you have enough data to fill the desired disk.
 *
 * Once the data has been generated, you also need to create a checksum of that data.
 * Calculate the checksum **only** for the data that fits on the disk, even if you
 * generated more data than that in the previous step.
 *
 * The checksum for some given data is created by considering each non-overlapping **pair**
 * of characters in the input data. If the two characters match (00 or 11), the next
 * checksum character is a 1. If the characters do not match (01 or 10), the next
 * checksum character is a 0. This should produce a new string which is exactly half
 * as long as the original. If the length of the checksum is **even**, repeat the process
 * until you end up with a checksum with an **odd** length.
 *
 * For example, suppose we want to fill a disk with length 12, and when we finally
 * generate a string of at least length 12, the first 12 characters are 110010110100.
 * To generate its checksum:
 *
 * - Consider each pair: 11, 00, 10, 11, 01, 00.
 * - These are same, same, different, same, different, same, producing 110101.
 * - The resulting string has length 6, which is even, so we repeat the process.
 * - The pairs are 11 (same), 01 (different), 01 (different).
 * - This produces the checksum 100, which has an odd length, so we stop.
 *
 * Therefore, the checksum for 110010110100 is 100.
 *
 * Combining all of these steps together, suppose you want to fill a disk with length
 * 20 using an initial state of 10000:
 *
 * - Because 10000 is too short, we first use the modified dragon curve to make it longer.
 * - After one round, it becomes 10000011110 (11 characters), still too short.
 * - After two rounds, it becomes 10000011110010000111110 (23 characters), which is enough.
 * - Since we only need 20, but we have 23, we get rid of all but the
 * first 20 characters: 10000011110010000111.
 * - Next, we start calculating the checksum; after one round, we have 0111110101,
 * which 10 characters long (**even**), so we continue.
 * - After two rounds, we have 01100, which is 5 characters long (**odd**), so we are done.
 *
 * In this example, the correct checksum would therefore be 01100.
 *
 * @param initial The initial data to start from.
